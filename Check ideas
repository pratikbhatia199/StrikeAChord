Foreign key:
1. Check if the entry present in Member is present in basic user and unique
2. Member gets recommended only those songs that he has mastered

Business logic:
1. Ensure that no user has recommendations dating past his expiration date.
    Optional -> has weekly recommendations for every week prior to his expiration date (upto only 4 weeks)



1<= examples:
1. Artist -> Song (performs relationship)
2. Song -> Artist (performs relationship)
3. Basic User -> Chords (has_mastered relationship)

0<=1 examples:
1. Member -> gets recommended
